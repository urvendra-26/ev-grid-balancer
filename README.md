# EV‑Grid Balancer ⚡

An AI‑driven system to optimize electric vehicle charging by predicting grid load and encouraging charging during low‑load, cleaner energy periods.

## Problem
Uncontrolled EV charging in Tier‑2 cities overloads local power grids and increases reliance on coal‑based electricity.

## Solution
We use machine learning to predict grid load, provide smart charging recommendations, and gamify sustainable charging behavior.

## Features
- Grid load prediction
- Smart EV charging recommendations
- Real‑time charging station map
- User rewards & leaderboard

## Tech Stack
- React
- Firebase
- Machine Learning (Python)
- OpenStreetMap
